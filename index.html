                    <p>Hi, my name is Joe. Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer - going through Case Western's bootcamp in hopes of entering the world of development. I'm looking for fun, creative and innovative work. </p>

                    <p>I was drawn to the technology field at an early age, because I find it incredible that with this knowledge you can develop tons of different software, you can build websites from the ground up, develop apps for anything you can think of, and overall it presents a good challenge to work towards and accomplish. I want to use development to help people, by creating solutions to busniess problems that exceeds their expectations.</p>
